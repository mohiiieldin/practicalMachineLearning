#### One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. 

#### i used several algorithms like bagging with CART, boosting with GBM, random forests and model stack.
